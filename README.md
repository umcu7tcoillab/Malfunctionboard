# Malfunctionboard

## About us
This design has been made by the coil-lab of the High Field MRI Group of the UMC Utrecht in the Netherlands, where we make hardware to support our researchers. We are part of a research group which means we feel the need to open up some of our designs to whomever can make use of it, to further the research of MRI applications.


## The design
This project contains a Malfunctionboard made for our 7T Philips Achieva MRI system. It has been tested inside the magnetic field of the 7T MRI. 

The Malfunctionboard is used to check the state of the PIN-diodes of the attachted coil. Between 1 and 3 diodes (0.4-2.6V) passes the test, otherwise the malfunctionline will not be pulled high.

The design and subsequent drawing has been done in Kicad 5.1.5.


## Download
Gerber and BOM production files for the latest _field tested_ version of the PCB can be found in the 'Releases' page, or by following [this link](https://github.com/umcu7tcoillab/Malfunctionboard/releases/latest). 
You can also make your own production files by downloading the Kicad project and generating them, but these are not guaranteed to have been field tested.
